	"It seems that 'Hello World' has been mangled!  It's okay though, because we're smart "
	"and we can figure out how to remedy this situation.  If you're wondering why it printed our gibberish AND 'nil' "
	"it's because 'nil' (which essentially means 'nothing') is println's return value." 
	"Let's experiment until we figure out what went wrong.  "
	"It seems that the " (code "reverse") " should fix things -- so type the following into the REPL: "]

       [:p.bottom
	"Hmm. It did indeed set it right, but this isn't what we were looking for!  That doesn't even look like a string. "
	"Reverse took our string, reversed it, and now we have a sequence of characters.  You can tell this because each "
	"character has a  '\\' (backslash in layman's terms) preceeding it.  Clojure uses those to denote Character (big 'C' character) literals.  "
	"We need a string though! "
	"What do we do when we need a string, but we have something else that isn't stringy (a highly technical term)?  No, we don't go to the shop "
	"and buy string cheese (not to disparage string cheese mind you), but instead we use the lovely " (code "str") " function!  Try this: "]

       [:p.bottom
	"Ooh! So close.  It appears that the str function is making the entire sequence a string!  Sequences can be made to "
	" look like strings.  str works on any number of arguments.  You can pass str any number of arguments and it will "
	"call Java's toString method on each of them to change them into a string, and then it will concatenate them "
	"all into one mammoth string.  Unfortunately, all of our characters are stuck in this sequence!  How can we get them out "
	"of the sequence, and pass them all to str?  Do not fear, young Clojurian, for I have the answer.  We use the "
	(code "apply") " function.  " (code "apply") " takes a function and a sequence, and 'unrolls' the sequence, "
	"passing all of its elements to the function as arguments.  Basically, it takes the sequence "
	"and dumps its elements into the argument list of the supplied function; which is exactly what we need.  "

       "Now that we've covered the basics of prefix math, let's take some time to play with sequences."]
      [:p.bottom
       "In Clojure, the term 'sequence' is an abstraction that many data structures "
       "implement.  This abstraction allows any function that works on a 'seq' (pronounced seek) to work on any data "
       "structure that is seqable.  This means all Clojure and Java collections, strings, and even I/O streams."]
      [:p.bottom
       "In isolation this doesn't make sense, so let's play with vectors.  A literal vector looks like this: " (code "[1 2 3 \"four\" 5 6.0]") ".  Vectors are the "
       "most commonly used collection in Clojure, along with maps.  Let's see if we can square all of the elements "
       "of a vector: " (code "(map (fn [x] (* x x)) [1 2 3 4 5])") ".  Try that out.  The " (code "map") " function takes "
       "a function that takes a single argument and returns a value, which it 'applies' to each element of its second argument, a sequence.  "
       "The resulting sequence is then returned."]
      [:p.bottom
       "We have introduced something new here -- the anonymous function.  Anonymous functions are used quite heavily in Clojure code.  "
       "The are created using " (code "fn") ".  After fn, you supply a vector of arguments that the "
       "function takes, and then the body of the function that uses those arguments to computer a value.  Clojure has "
       "short hand for anonymous functions as well.  The above anonymous function can be rewritten using a shorthand form: "
       (code "#(+ % %)") ".  When you use this shorthand, the function arguments are accessed like so: % or %1 for the "
       "first argument, %2 for the second argument, %3 for the third and so on.  Our code now looks like this: "
       (code "(map #(* % %) [1 2 3 4 5])")]
      [:p.bottom
       "Another highly important collection is the hashmap.  A literal hashmap looks like this: "
       (code "{:key \"value\" :key2 3 :key4 [3 4 2 1]}") ".  The keys in this map are something called 'keywords'.  "
       "You can tell that they are keywords because they start with a colon ':' character.  They're like symbols that "
       "resolve to themselves.  In idiomatic Clojure code, keywords are often used as map keys.  You can use many objects as map keys, "
       "including integers, vectors, strings, and other maps."]
      [:p.bottom
       "To get a value at a key in a map, we can do this: " (code "({:key1 :val} :key1)") ".  I bet you're all lolwut "
       "right now, aren't you?  In Clojure, hashmaps are functions that take a single argument, which should be a key "
       "and they lookup the key within themselves and return the value at the key or nil if the key doesn't exist.  "
       "Another neat trick for maps with keywords for keys is this: " (code "(:key1 {:key1 :val})") ".  Keywords are "
       "also functions.  They just look themselves up in the supplied map."]
      [:p.bottom
       "Clojure has all sorts of other data structures as well.  Sets, lists, queues, zippers, etc.  We'll talk about some of "

       "We've learned a little about Clojure's sequences, so let's use them to do some stuff.  I've been wondering how "
       "many vowels are in the word \"teddybear\".  Aren't you wondering the same thing? It's absolutely agonizing not "
       "knowing! We're programmers, you and I, so we shouldn't have to count those vowels ourselves.  Indeed, we don't "
       "We can use Clojure to count them for us!"]
      [:p.bottom
       "Okay, we'll start with the string \"teddybear\".  We're going to be using this string a lot, and we don't want "
       "to have to keep typing it over and over again, do we?  Luckily, Clojure can help us here.  Type this into the "
       "REPL: " (code "(def teddy \"teddybear\")") ".  What def does is pretty simple: it simply gives a name to a "
       "value so that we can refer to it by that name later.  Don't worry about what the REPL printed when you typed "
       "that, it's just trying to show you exactly where the var is mapped (in this case, a sandbox generated namespace.  "
       "We need to make sure it worked.  Type this into the REPL: " (code "teddy") ".  Cool huh?"]
      [:p.bottom
       "Now that we are armed with a loaded teddybear, we can start figuring out how to find out the number of vowels.  "
       "For this, we need to introduce a new collection type: sets.  A literal set looks like this: " (code "#{3 4 5 \"x\" \\y}")
       ".  A set can hold anything, but it can't hold any two of the same thing.  In a set, there can be no duplicate objects.  "
       "Another important fact about sets is that they, like maps, are also functions. A set is a function that takes  "
       "an argument and looks inside itself to see if that same object is inside of it.  If this is true, it returns the "
       "object, or returns nil.  Let's try this out for ourselves: "]

       "functions, it can be used to make a really elegant solution to a problem like this."]
      [:p.bottom
       "Okay, so we have a way to test if a character is a vowel. We can simply do this: " (code "(#{\\a \\e \\i \\o \\u} e)")
       ".  Since we're going to be using the set of vowels a lot, go ahead and give it a name in the REPL: "
       (code "(def vowels #{\\a \\e \\i \\o \\u})") ".  Now we can use " (code "vowels") " to refer to the set of vowels.  "]
      [:p.bottom
       "Now, we have a way to find out if a character is a vowel, now we just need a way to remove everything that isn't "
       "a vowel from our teddybear string.  I have just the function!  We need " (code "filter") ".  Filter takes what "
       "is called a 'predicate', that is, a function that returns true or false, and it applies this function to each "
       "element of a sequence in turn. If the predicate function returns false or nil for an element, that element is "
       "removed from the sequence. If the predicate function returns anything that isn't false or nil for an element, "
       "that element is left alone.  In Clojure, anything that isn't false or nil is considered a true value."]
      [:p.bottom
       "Let's try filter out a bit.  Let's try to filter out all odd numbers from a sequence of numbers.  Clojure has "
       "a function called " (code "odd?") " that we can use.  Putting a question mark at the end is a Clojure naming convention "
       "for functions that are predicates (return either true or false).  Try it out in the REPL:"]

      (code "(odd? 2)")

       "Okay, now we need a sequence of numbers.  We could type these out by hand, but that's tedious, and as Clojure "
       "programmers, we do not tolerate 'tedious'.  We can use Clojure's range function to generate these numbers for us.  "
       (code "range") ", if given one integer, will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to the integer that you passed to "
       "it. Try this: " (code "(range 10)") ".  We have a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9.  Apparently, the upper-bound "
       "(the number you passed to range) is 'inclusive', meaning it's not included in the resulting range.  If we really "

      [:p.bottom
       "We don't really want the zero, so let's give range a lower-bound, along with an upper-bound.  It can take two "
       "arguments: " (code "(range 1 11)") ".  There we go! We have all of the numbers from 1 to 10.  Now, let's use "
       "filter and the odd? function to get all of the odd numbers out of the sequence.  Try this: "

       "Now that we know how to use filter, we can now use it to filter out all of the vowels in our teddy string.  "
