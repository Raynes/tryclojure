<p>
  Let's see what you just did: you evaluated a list where the first element is the function itself, defined on the spot - and the other elements are the arguments that you pass to the function.
  That's exactly the same syntax that you used earlier on to call functions like <code>square</code> or even <code>+</code>.
  The only difference is that now you defined the function in the same place where you called it.

<p>
  Remember <code>defn</code>?
  Now I can tell you a secret: <code>defn</code> is actually just a bit of syntactic sugar around <code>def</code> and <code>fn</code>.
  You've just seen <code>fn</code> at work: it defines a new function.
  <code>def</code> binds the newly defined function to a name.
</p>

<p>
   If you want, you can create a named functions without using <code>defn</code>: type <code class="expr">(def square (fn [x] (* x x)))</code> to continue.
