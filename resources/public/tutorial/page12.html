<p>Excellent work.</p>

<p>
  Well, that's all there is right now. This tutorial is still a work in progress, and I'm working on more
  steps. If anybody wants to contribute, you can find a link to the Github repository on the 'about' page.
  Furthermore, if you're just a brand new Clojure developer looking for some learning experiences, check
  out the 'links' page. You'll find links to some tutorials and such there.
